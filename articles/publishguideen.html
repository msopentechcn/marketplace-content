    <h1>Azure Marketplace Service Provider Guide [<a href="../publishguide/">中文版</a>]</h1>
    <p>This guide provides ISV overall procedures from entering Azure Marketplace to product release.</p>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This guide is intended for ISVs that wish to provide virtual machine (hereinafter refer to as VM) image products, ARM templates and custom services (i.e. solutions) for Chinese users in Azure Marketplace by Microsoft Azure, which are operated by 21Vianet.</li>
        <li>This guide does not apply to service providers (such as SaaS providers, API service providers, etc.) offering non-VM images or custom service offerings.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is Azure Marketplace</h2>
    <p>Azure Marketplace is an image repository for third-party ISVs to publish their image and custom services; and to help Azure users quickly create VM instances, clusters or find suitable Azure-based solutions, which helps connect Azure users, Azure ISVs or partner directly.</p>
    <p>Azure Marketplace makes it easier to find, retrieve, and use well-tested and fully tested applications on the Azure platform and makes sure the application running smoothly on Azure.</p>
    <p>ISVs, through Azure Marketplace, can bring new business channels and users; and dramatically simplify the software promotion, management and deployment.</p>
    <h2>Product</h2>
    <p>Azure Marketplace currently supports VM Image, ARM Template, and Custom Services. More products will be supported in the future.</p>
    <h2>Business model</h2>
    <p>Azure Marketplace currently supports free and Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model.</p>
    <p>The following table describes business models currently supported in Azure Marketplace. A product / service can include SKUs that use different pricing models.</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th><strong>Pricing model</strong></th>
                <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
                <th><strong>Object</strong></th>

            <tr>
                <td>Free</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Free Trial</td>
                <td>SKUs are free in limited time. During the trial period, Azure Marketplace fees will not be charged for usage of the product. After the trial expires, customers using the product are automatically charged based on the standard rates. Azure Marketplace does not currently prevent users from creating multiple subscriptions for free trial products. Service providers that create free trial product subscriptions for customers are expected to provide the appropriate restrictions.</td>
                <td>VM image, ARM template</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>BYOL</td>
                <td>Comes with a license (BYOL) SKU. Customer is entitled to access or use the Product / Service outside of the Azure Marketplace and does not charge the customer for the Azure Marketplace fee due to Customer's usage of the Product / Service in it.</td>
