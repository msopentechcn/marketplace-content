    <h3>SECTION 4 Licensing of Offerings and Support.</h3>
    <p>
        (a) Licensing of Offerings. You are responsible for licensing or
        otherwise granting rights to your Offerings, including all Offering
        Contents associated therewith, to Customers. Such licenses and
        grants will be between you and Customers and will not create any
        obligations or responsibilities of any kind for 21Vianet. With
        respect to the web-based management portal experience for the
        Marketplace, use of your Offerings shall be conditioned upon a
        &quot;<strong>click to agree</strong>&quot; acceptance of your Terms of Use and Privacy
        Statement by Customers. 21Vianet may also enable Customers to access
        Offerings through Marketplace APIs. You acknowledge that 21Vianet
        grants no rights or license to your Offerings through the operation
        of the Marketplace or through enabling you to provide your Offerings
        through the Marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) Support. You are responsible for supporting your Offerings. You will
        ensure that any support options described in your Listing
        Information remain available to Customers for as long as the
        relevant Offering is available in the Marketplace or is otherwise
        provided to Customers during any Wind-Down Period. For each Offering
        that you publish in the Marketplace, you must make support available
        to Customers, either as offered for free, or as a support offering
        that may be separately purchased outside of the Marketplace. You
        must provide commercially reasonable support to Customers for
        inquiries related to deployment of Offerings via the Marketplace.
        You must make technical support contacts available to 21Vianet via
        e-mail and telephone for notification in the event that there are
        any technical problems with any Offering. If we contact you
        regarding a problem that requires your support, you must respond
        promptly and provide a resolution within a commercially reasonable
        period of time. You agree to work with us to identify or isolate
        root cause issues and fixes in necessary scenarios. Our sole
        obligation with respect to customer service for any Offering is to
        make your customer service contact information reasonably available
        to Customers. We reserve the right to require Customers to purchase
        Azure support plans before we will provide any support to Customers
        related to the Azure services, including root cause analysis. You
        will ensure that the contact information you provide in the
        Publishing Portal and in the Listing Information associated with
        each Offering remains accurate and current.
    </p>
    <h3>SECTION 5 Privacy.</h3>
    <p>
        (a) Use of Customer Information and Customer Data. You may use Customer
        Data only to provide your Offering. You may use Customer Information
        to provide your Offering, to contact Customers to the extent
        permitted in Section 5(c), to prevent fraud, to provide support, or
        to perform statistical analysis. You may not use Customer Data or
        Customer Information for any other purposes unless you obtain
        permission from Customers for such other purposes in your Privacy
        Statement or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) Privacy Statement. Your Privacy Statement must (i) comply with
        applicable laws and regulations; (ii) inform Customers about any
        Customer Data or Customer Information that you collect and how that
        information is used, stored, secured, and disclosed; and (iii)
        describe the controls that Customers have over the use and sharing
        of their Customer Data and Customer Information and how they may
        access their data and information. Our privacy policies apply solely
        to Customers' use of Azure services and will not apply to Customers'
        use of any third-party Offering. If a Service Offering (as defined
        in the Marketplace Participation Policies) is hosted, or if an
        Offering includes hosted components, you must indicate all countries
        in which the service may be hosted and where any Customer Data may
        be stored. This information must be made available in your Privacy
        Statement and your Listing Information to enable Customers to
        determine how to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or
        policies governing the use and transfer of their data.
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) Communications with Customers. You may use Customer Information to
        contact Customers for Transactional Purposes only. You may not
        contact any Customer for Promotional Purposes unless the Customer
        has provided affirmative, opt-in consent to receive such
        communications from you. This section does not restrict you from
        using other Customer contact information that you acquire
        independently outside of the Marketplace for any purpose, even if
        that information is identical to the Customer Information we provide
        to you or that you obtain through the Marketplace, provided that you
        do not target communications on the basis of the intended recipient
        being an Azure customer. &quot;<strong>Transactional Purposes</strong>&quot; encompasses
        communications directly related to the provision or operation of
        your Offering and includes communications about support for your
        Offering, service downtime, changes to your Terms of Use, and
        notification or delivery of invoices. &quot;<strong>Promotional Purposes</strong>&quot;
        encompasses communications related to offering or advertising
        products or services, feedback requests, links to training or other
        resources, and any other communications that are not solely for
        Transactional Purposes. Your communications with Customers must
        comply with all applicable laws.
    </p>
    <h3>SECTION 6 Appointment of 21Vianet.</h3>
    <p>
        The Marketplace is a forum through which Offerings are made available
        by service providers. 21Vianet's role is to provide the technology and
        services to enable this forum for you. You appoint 21Vianet to act as
        your agent or commissionaire, as applicable, for these purposes, and
        you acknowledge that you, not 21Vianet, are the provider, and licensor
        of your Offerings to Customers.
    </p>

    <p>
        (a) Removal of Offerings. Removal of an Offering will result in the
        Offering no longer being visible in the Marketplace or available
        for additional Customers to deploy. However, Customers that have already
        deployed the Offering before it is removed from the Marketplace will be
        able to continue to use the Offering to the same extent as prior to removal.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Termination of an Offering means that we will notify existing
                Customers that the Offering has been terminated and may no
                longer be used after a specific termination date for any
                continued use of the Offering after the termination date. You
                agree that we will have no responsibility or liability for
                Customers' unauthorized use of your Offering after the
                termination date.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                If an Offering is terminated, existing customers will be able to
                continue to use the Offering for 90 days or until expiration of
                the term of the Customer's subscription to your Offering,
                whichever is longer (&quot;<strong>Wind-Down Period</strong>&quot;). You must continue to
                provide any services that are part of your Offering to each
                existing Customer during that Customer's Wind-Down Period.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Except in cases where termination is legally required or is
                otherwise necessitated by compelling circumstances, such as
                fraud or a claim of intellectual property infringement, we will
                not terminate any Offering prior to completion of its Wind-Down
                Period, and we will not terminate any non-Service Offering
                during the term of this Agreement.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANLIKE
        EFFORT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT RELATING TO THE AZURE SERVICES AND THE
        MARKETPLACE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
        ANY WARRANTIES THAT ACCESS TO, OR USE OF, THE AZURE SERVICES OR THE

    </p>
    <p>

        PARTY'S AND ITS AFFILIATES', LICENSORS' AND/OR SUPPLIERS' LIABILITY
        UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO \$5,000.

        EVEN IF THE PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) Scope. For clarity, the disclaimer and limitation of liability
        provisions in this Section 10 pertain to you solely in your capacity
        as a service provider in the Marketplace. Neither the foregoing
        provisions nor any other provisions in this Agreement are intended
        to apply to your use of any Azure services in your capacity as an
        Azure customer, if applicable.

        us, our Affiliates and our licensors and suppliers, as applicable,

        damages, expenses, and attorneys' fees) any and all third-party
        claims:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                alleging that your Offering or Listing Information infringes any
                proprietary or personal right of a third party;
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                arising from any dispute between you and a Customer relating to
                your Offering; or
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                based on your failure to collect, remit, or report any sales,
                use, goods and services, value added, or other similar tax that
                you are obligated to collect, remit, or report, including any
                associated penalties and interest.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will (A) notify you promptly in writing of the claim, provided that our failure to notify you will not relieve you of any liability except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices your legal rights; and (B) at your reasonable request, provide you with reasonable assistance in defending the claim. You agree to reimburse us, our Affiliates and licensors and suppliers, as applicable, for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance. You may not make any settlement or compromise of a claim, or admit or stipulate any fault or liability on the part of us, our Affiliates or licensors and/or suppliers with respect to any claim covered by this section without the express, prior written consent from us, our Affiliates or licensors and/or suppliers (as applicable).</p>

        expedited basis if we terminate this Agreement for material breach.
        Sections of this Agreement that, by their terms, require performance
        or establish rights or protections after the termination or
        expiration of this Agreement will survive.
    </p>

    <p>
        (a) Affiliates. We may perform certain of our obligations under this
        Agreement through one or more Affiliates. We may also appoint one or
        more of our Affiliates to act as our agents in different regions.

        interest in any software or other materials exchanged by the
        parties. Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted.
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) No Exclusivity. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the rights
        granted to and obligations due to the other party in this Agreement
        are intended to be non-exclusive and therefore that nothing in this
        Agreement will be deemed or construed to prohibit either party from
        engaging in or participating itself or with one or more third
        parties in business arrangements similar to or competitive with
        those described herein.
    </p>
    <p>
        (d) Jurisdiction and Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by
        the laws of the People Republic of China. Any dispute or claim
        arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement,
        or the breach termination or invalidity hereof (including the
        validity, scope and enforceability of this Section) will be
        submitted to China International Economic and Trade Arbitration
        Commission (&quot;<strong>CIETAC</strong>&quot;) for arbitration, which arbitration shall be
        conducted in Beijing in accordance with the CIETAC\'s arbitration
        rules in effect at the time of applying for arbitration. The
        arbitral award will be final and binding upon both parties. This
        Section, however, will not prevent either party from seeking
        injunctive relief in the appropriate jurisdiction for any (i)
        violation of that party's intellectual property rights, (ii) breach
        of confidentiality obligations owed to that party under this

        in any appropriate jurisdiction.

    <p>
        (e) Costs. Each party is solely responsible for all costs and expenses
        incurred by it in connection with its performance of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        (f) Responding to Claims. If we receive a claim from a third party
        requesting that your Offering be changed or removed, we may refer
        that claim to you. You must comply with the notice as soon as
        reasonably practicable. If you discover that your Offering violates
        the terms of this Agreement, you must immediately notify us and work
        with us to cure the violation.
    </p>
    <p>
        (g) Waiver. Either party's delay or failure to exercise any right or
        remedy will not result in a waiver of that or any other right or
        remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
        (h) Severability. If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that
        any provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid, or
        unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force
        and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement (or any rights
        or duties under it) without the other party's prior written consent,
        provided that either party may assign this Agreement without the
        other party's consent (i) to an Affiliate, or (ii) in connection
        with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of
        its assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that our
        right to continue providing the Azure services ends, we may assign
        this agreement to another entity with forty-five (45) days' notice
        to you. Either party who assigns this Agreement as permitted in this
        Section 12(j) shall provide the other party with prompt notice of
        such assignment. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be
        binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their
        permitted successors and assigns.

    <p>
        (j) Subcontractors. We may sublicense our rights under this Agreement to
        third parties or otherwise authorize third parties to assist us in
        performing our obligations or exercising our rights under this
        Agreement. We will, subject to the terms of this Agreement, be
        responsible for the performance of such third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        (k) Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for failure to perform
        any obligation under this Agreement to the extent such failure is
        caused by a force majeure event, including acts of God, natural
        disasters, war, civil disturbance, action by governmental entity,
        strike, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the party
        seeking recourse under this Section 12(k). The party affected by the
        force majeure event will provide notice to the other party within a
        commercially reasonable time and will use reasonable efforts to
        resume performance. Obligations not performed due to a force majeure
        event will be performed as soon as reasonably possible when the
        force majeure event ends. Lack of funds will not constitute an event
        of force majeure.
    </p>
    <p>
        (l) Relationship of Parties. Neither this Agreement, nor any terms and
        conditions contained herein, create a partnership, joint venture,
        employment relationship, or franchise relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
        (m) Updates. We may update this Agreement from time to time. If we
        update this Agreement, we will indicate the last date on which the
        Agreement was modified at the top of the Agreement and provide you
        with 30 days' notice prior to the effective date of the updated
        version of the Agreement. By continuing to make Offerings available
        in the Marketplace after such notice period, you agree to be bound
        by the terms and conditions contained in the updated Agreement. The
        foregoing notice period will not apply to updates to the Marketplace
        Publication Technical Guidelines, or the Marketplace Participation
        Policies, which we may update at any time. In the event of a
        conflict between the terms of this document and the terms of the
        Marketplace Publication Technical Guidelines, or the Marketplace
        Participation Policies, this document will control.

        acknowledge and agree that other service providers may reference your
        Offerings in their ARM Templates in a manner consistent with this

        service provider's ARM Template, you will remain the service provider of
        your Offering for all Customer deployments of the ARM Template, your
        Terms of Use and Privacy Statement will continue to govern your
        relationship with such Customers, and such other service provider will
        not be entitled to any of the Service Provider Net Receipts attributable
        to Customers' use of your Offering. Any software or data installed in
